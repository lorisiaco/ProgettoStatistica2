The work carried out consists  to interpret, through regression models, the trend of the price of gold and its relation with the regressors present in the dataset.

In the first part of the project we answer the following questions:
1)How does the price of gold (Gold_Price) behave based on the other observed attributes?
2)There is multicollinearity in the model selected in the previous step(1)?
3)In the model selected in point (1) are the residuals normal? Do they have a mean of zero?
4)Is there a relationship between the price of oil (Crude_Oil) and the dollar index (USD_Index)?
5)Is it possible to use the WLS method for the model selected in the first point (1)?

In the second part we focused on the following methods:
1)Predicting Gold_Price in relation to CPI using the linear regression model with ARIMA errors
2)Prediction using a state-space model
